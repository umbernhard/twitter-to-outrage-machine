twitter-to-social-media
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'Twitter' with 'Social Media' and 'tweet' to 'post'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/DanieleSalatti/twitter-to-social-media/raw/master/Twitter2SocialMedia.crx)

Fork of cloud-to-butt, mostly done so I could troll my friends at Facebook and Twitter.

At the moment the extension breaks the URLs, that will need to be fixed.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag CloudToButt.crx into the page that appears.
